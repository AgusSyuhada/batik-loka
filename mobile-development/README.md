# BatikLoka - Explore, Scan, and Learn Batik Heritage

### 📜 Executive Summary

**BatikLoka** is a mobile application project aimed at preserving and promoting the cultural heritage of Indonesian batik. By leveraging technology, we address the declining recognition of batik among younger generations due to the lack of accessible and engaging resources.

Our app provides features such as batik pattern scanning, detailed information about batik styles, a comprehensive catalog, and updates on batik-related news. It acts as both an educational tool and a digital repository, fostering a deeper appreciation for batik's artistic and historical significance. Through this initiative, we aim to connect the younger generation with their cultural roots and empower them to embrace and promote batik as a living tradition.
