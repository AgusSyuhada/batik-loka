# BatikLoka - Explore, Scan, and Learn Batik Heritage

### üìú Backgrounder Mobile Development  

The **Mobile Development** aspect of the project focused on **creating a dynamic and user-friendly application** that adhered to **modern development standards.** **Using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture**, the app ensured a clear separation of concerns, facilitating scalability and ease of testing. The app's **interface was designed with a focus on usability**, incorporating **intuitive navigation and visually appealing elements**. **Networking calls** were implemented to interact with APIs, including the deployed batik recognition model and the news API, **ensuring real-time updates and reliable data retrieval**. Authentication features were enhanced by **implementing OTP (One-Time Password) verification** during user registration, ensuring a secure and straightforward onboarding process. Additionally, **local data persistence using Room databases** enabled offline access to user data. This comprehensive approach resulted in a responsive, efficient, and user-centric mobile application.
